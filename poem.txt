The Rainbow and the Unicorn

The Gift of Color 
Splashed across the skies
that appears after the rain 
with the help of the Sun's rays.
What a beautil display of God's gift
as promise to never distroy the earth with water.
At the end of the Rainbow there is no pot of Gold,
but there is a beautiful Unicorn feasting on skittle colored grass.
As the unicorn walks she notices a tree of tiny golden fruit that grows in a cluster.
